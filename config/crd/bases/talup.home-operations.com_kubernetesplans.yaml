            KubernetesPlan is the Schema for the kubernetesplans API

            KubernetesPlan manages Kubernetes control plane upgrades in a Talos cluster.
            It performs upgrades on control plane nodes sequentially to ensure cluster stability.

            Prerequisites:
            - A Secret named "talup" must exist in the same namespace containing the talosconfig
            - The secret must have a key "talosconfig" with valid Talos configuration data
            - Target control plane nodes must be accessible via the provided talosconfig
